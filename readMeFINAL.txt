When the program is run it will present you with a few options. 
to select the function you would like to use type the number that is next to the name of the program then press ENTER. If you type anything other then one of the applicable numbers the program will tell you that isnt a valid input.

the first option is just adding an integer to your list it will ask you what value you want to add.
The second option will tell you what integer is in a specific index position.
The third will pick and output a random value that is in your list.
The fourth will add as many values as you tell it to within a range of values that you have to input.
The fifth will go through your list and sort it by the value of the integer (lowest first) it will make a new list that the sorted list is put into.
The sixth option will go through your list 1 by 1 and compare the value your looking for to the value its on. This is the least optomized search algorithm in this program.
The seventh will split your list into two pieces the higher half and the lower half. if the value youre looking for is in the higher half it will take the higher half and split it into two, the function will keep on splitting till it finds the value you're looking for.
The eigth is quite similar to the seventh except instead of the function calling itself (as in the recursive search) it is just a loop that splits the list into two halfs progressively.
the ninth will ask you which list you want to print and then will print it
the tenth will make a new list of an inputed length then sort it

one function i would like to add is the ability to time how long each search algorithm takes so I could compare the efficencies of each algorithm.
